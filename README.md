bootstrap-force-device
======================

Simulate a different device width within a given bootstrap container

Surprisingly straight-forward solution to a fairly thin use-case, but if you need it you need it! Only requires CSS. Just add the .force CSS into your project AFTER the Bootstrap CSS, and add .force-xs, .force-sm, .force-md or .force-lg to any div containing the content you want to force to behave like it's on a different device. That's it.
